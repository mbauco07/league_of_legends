//THIS ABOVE STATS ARE THE ONES THAT CAN BE MODIFIED/CHANGED VIA PER LEVEL INCREASES WITHOUT ITEMS MODIEFIEERS, we will call these "base stats"


Different stats have diffetent wayts to round the values:
AD, Heath and Energy Regen all round to the ones place
AS rounds to the hundreth place, 
Both of this applies to the initial values (level 1) as well


Calculations:
-Attack Speed, calculating attack speed is diffetent because it has a ration that is followed per level: 
    -To calculate it you take the attackspeedperlevel (aspl) value multiply it by the champion level-1 (cpl) (we -1 because we start a level 1 not level 0) multiply by the level 1 attack speed (as)
    - divide but 100 then readd the original lvl 1 attack speed : ((aspl*cpl)*as)/100 + as


DDragon Items Stats Naming Conventions:
Stats are called flat if you add them together, and percent if you multiply them together.
